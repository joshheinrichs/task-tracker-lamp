# task-tracker-lamp

A simple task tracker built using [LAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)), inspired by Atlassian JIRA. This was built in a few days for my CMPT 350 course, and likely won't be extended. The structure of this program is based off of [php_mvc](https://github.com/Raindal/php_mvc).
